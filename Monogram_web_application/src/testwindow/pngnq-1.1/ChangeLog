17th June 2011 Version 1.1 Released

Bugfixes:

Fixed -d option so that it gives the correct directory now.

Removed spurious error message when -Qf option was given.

Include unistd.h for getopt, will use the bundled freegetopt if getopt is no available.

Can now overwrite files in place.

Fix for images with mainly one color being quantized with a low number of colors so that
they now should have the correct transparent areas.
