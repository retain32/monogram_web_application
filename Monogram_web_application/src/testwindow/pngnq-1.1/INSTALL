INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
This should work on most UNIX style systems:

tar -xzvf pngnq-1.1.tar.gz
cd pngnq-1.1
./configure
make
sudo make install


NOTES:
There may be warnings about strings being too long. Unless you have a really ancient 
compiler these can be safely ignored. If you really don't like warnings add --std=c99 
to the CFLAGS or get rid of --pedantic.

If you successfully build this on a system other than those listed below please 
tell me. Also tell me if it does not work. 

 
Cheers,
